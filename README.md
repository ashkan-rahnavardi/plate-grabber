# Plate Grabber

## Description
I developed this application as an alternative to the paper forms the Traffic Department in the City of Vancouver uses to track license plates of cars parked on a street. Instead of having to manually write down license plates this app allows you to take photos of license plates and it extracts the licenseplate information from the photo. 

The main branch features the first itteration of the app, purely front-end with simple UI and using local storage for data persistence. 

The dev branch features the second itteration of the app (currently in progress), I have connected MongoDB for the backend database, NextAuth for authentification and I am re-amping the UI using Shadcn UI library. 

## Technologies Used
- React-Camera-Pro (modified version)
- Next.js v14
- NextAuth v5
- MongoDB
- Plate Recognition API

## Future Features
- Homebrewed AI for license plate information extraction
