# Plate Grabber

## Description
I developed this application as an alternative to the paper forms the Traffic Department in the City of Vancouver uses to track license plates of cars parked on a street. Instead of having to manually write down license plates this app allows you to take photos of license plates and it extracts the licenseplate information from the photo. 

## Technologies Used
This app uses a slightly modified version of 'react-camera-pro' to capture the photos and then sends the photo to an API service to retrieve the license plate information. It currently saves all saved forms to local storage for faster development, however I am currently in the process of connecting firebase as the backend. 

## Future Features
&ensp;- User authentification / secure login system

&ensp;- Homebrewed AI for license plate information extraction
